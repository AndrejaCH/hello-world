# hello-world
*A note from the future*

Hello World! This is Andreja from the future talking to future me. 
On May 8th I created my very first repository (by now I am sure github will know this information for sure). But at that time I didn,t know it is possible. Actually I didn't know anything abou github and README file. That's why my original README file looked like this:  

"ideas, practice, new-stuff"
Hello everyone! 

I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it."

:confused: :tired_face: :sweat_smile:

I had no idea what I am doing. I found it very hard and confusing. But today on May 23rd, two weeks later (only two weeks later!) I know what it's going on! I fact I have fun doing this. I am writting README file and I smile. It might not be the ***usual*** README file (hey did you notice italic and bold letters! It's called a *Markdown*. I didn't know about this either!) So two weeks later.. many things changed. Yes, I did put lots of effort, yes I have been reading a lot about it, and yes, I had a small breakown |:tired-face:| 
but - heads up! I did it! here are things after two weeks of hard work.. I want to share with everyone want it and will benefit from it -- also one thing I have learned form github -- is sharing!! and I want to share it with myself too - today on May 23rd I am going on a completely new path of becoming an awesome data analysts. And I knoe it is going to be difficult at some point - I am almost certain I will say that I should't gone for it -- and that's why I am writtig this message to future me and to someone that feels the same -- I can do it! I did it once and I can do it again!!just do it little by little -- every step counts, baby steps, small steps, tinny steps --it's worth it..

  <h1> Hello world </h1>
  <h2> Hello world </h2>
  <h3> Hello world </h3>
  <h4> Hello world </h4>
  <h5> Hello world </h5>
  <h6> Hello world </h6>
 
 this is my very first README. It is so much to learn. Now even writting a simple text is not the same anymore.
 I can make test **bold** *italic* or ***both***. Wow so many differernt things.
   
 My very first git commints all in one place...
