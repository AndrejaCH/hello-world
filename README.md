# hello-world
*My first repository*

On May 8th I created my **first repository**. It was a bit overwhelming :sweat_smile: because every step was new to me. Today on May 25th things look quite different. I have learned so many new things in just few weeks that I wanted to write it down in order to remember it in the future. I want to keep this repository as a reminder that with persistence many things are possible.
*My first README looked like this:*
>"ideas, practice, new-stuff"
>Hello everyone! 
>I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
>Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it."
I wasnâ€™t quite sure what is the purpose of the README.md :confused:
I did some readings, resrarch and got my hands dirty with trial and error. 
[GitHub Guides]( https://guides.github.com/) were very helpful. :+1:

***Creating first repository can be pretty difficult, but with a simple task list can be much easier:***
-	[ ]  finish changes
-	[ ] stage commits use `git add`
-	[ ] push commits use `git commit`
-	[ ] merge branches use `git merge`

**For _convenience_ I put together a list:** ![GitBasics.pdf](GitBasics.pdf)
