# hello-world
*<h2>My first repository</h2>*

On May 12th I created my **first repository**. It was a bit overwhelming :sweat_smile: because every step was new to me. Today on May 25th things look quite different. I have learned so many new things in just few weeks that I wanted to write it down in order to remember it in the future. I want to keep this repository as a reminder that with persistence many things are possible.
*My first README looked like this:*
>"ideas, practice, new-stuff"
>Hello everyone! 
>I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
>Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it."

I wasnâ€™t quite sure what is the purpose of the README.md :confused:
I did some readings, research and got my hands dirty with trial and error. 
[GitHub Guides]( https://guides.github.com/) were very helpful. :+1:

***Managing commits and using commands can be a bit confusing at the beggining,
but with a simple task list it is much easier:***

- [x] update local repo `git pull`
- [ ] finish changes
-	[ ] stage commits use `git add`
-	[ ] push commits use `git commit`
-	[ ] merge branches use `git merge`

**For _convenience_ I put together a list:** ![GitBasics](docs/GitBasics.pdf)

Different commands for local and remote repository

local git | remote git
----------|------------
mv <old_FileName> <new_FileName> | git mv <old_FileName> <new_FileName>
git init | create a new repo on GitHub

*Extras*:
Data analytics programs, its brief description and some useful terms:
