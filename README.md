Hello everyone! 

I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it.


  <h2> Hello world <h2>
 
 this is my very first README. It is so much to learn. Now even writting a simple text is not the same anymore.
 I can make test **bold** *italic* or ***both***. Wow so many differernt things.
   
 My very first git commints all in one place...
