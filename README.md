# hello-world
*My first repository*

<h4>Foreword</h4>

On May 8th I created my *first repository*. It was a bit overwhelming :sweat_smile: because, every step was new to me. Today on May 25th things look quite different. I have learned so many new things in just a few weeks. I wanted to write it down in order to remember it in the future and want to keep this repository as a reminder of how persistence can be rewarding.

<h4>My first README.md</h4>

>"ideas, practice, new-stuff"
>Hello everyone!
>I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
>Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it."

At that time I wasnâ€™t quite sure what is the purpose of the README.md :confused: But, this is just the beginning of an adventure! :upside_down_face:

<h4>My progress</h4>

I did lots of readings, research, and got my hands dirty with trial and error. Also many thanks to [GitHub Guides]( https://guides.github.com/) , they are very helpful. :+1:

I put together a few \*beginner guidelines\* that were very helpful when I was learning about Git & GitHub.

***A simple check-list***

*Managing commits and using commands can be a bit confusing at the beginning,
but with a simple task list it is much easier.*

- [x]  update local repository `git pull`
- [x]  finish and save changes
- [x] stage commits `git add`
- [x] commit changes `git commit`
- [x] push commits `git push`

***Basics Commands***

*For a better understanding of some commands I put together a list _GitBasics_:* ![GitBasics](docs/GitBasics.pdf)

***Troubleshooting***

*Commands can differ as you use them on your local repo or on remote repo. For example, changing the name of a file (see 1st row) or using `git init`.*

local git | remote git
----------|------------
mv <old_FileName> <new_FileName> | git mv <old_FileName> <new_FileName>
git init | create a new repo on GitHub

***Appendix***

*As a future Data Analysts I want to be well prepared with the terminology.*
