# hello-world
*A note from the future*

Hello World! This is Andreja from the future talking to future me. 
On May 8th I created my very first repository (by now I am sure github will know this information for sure). But at that time I didn,t know it is possible. Actually I didn't know anything abou github and README file. That's why my original README file looked like this:  

"ideas, practice, new-stuff"
Hello everyone! 

I am Andreja. New to this and super excited to start working on useful projects.
Love to learn, love music, love to go out and that's about it."

:confused: 
:tired-face:
:sweat-smile:

I had no idea what I am doing. I found it very hard and confusing. But today on May 23rd, two weeks later (only two weeks later!) I know what it's going on! I fact I have fun doing this. I am writting README file and I smile. It might not be the ***usual*** README file (hey did you notice italic and bold letters! It's called a *Markdown*. I didn't know about this either!) So 
  <h2> Hello world <h2>
 
 this is my very first README. It is so much to learn. Now even writting a simple text is not the same anymore.
 I can make test **bold** *italic* or ***both***. Wow so many differernt things.
   
 My very first git commints all in one place...
